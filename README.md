# comic-scraper
Scraper for downloading images from viewcomics.me, but should theoretically work for ripping all images from a page that have matching alt text.

## Usage
1. Clone repo, create `./out` directory for image output  
2. `npm i` 
3. `npm run script` 
4. Provide URL to page with images 
5. Provide string to match the beginning of the images' alt texts 
6. Optionally provide starting index
